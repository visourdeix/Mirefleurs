Per resource load results in higher client side load but is easier to build, and sometimes the only way to do it.

You would not need to maintain your contents on the CDN server as they are fetched automatically by the CDN service provider as soon as they are requested by users. Most response headers set by your servers will be respected by the CDN servers. Additional advantages with CDN servers are ability to ease load on your own server and also tapping into a much wider dedicated single purpose servers optimized to serve your contents.<br />2. Own Pull CDN(local) - this is jbetolos own implementation immitating Pull CDN servers. Requires only that you setup a subdomain and that your server has URL rewrite capability through .htaccess and jbetolo deals with the rest and should function just as the remote Pull CDN.
